# THE Problem Statement  
## Conventional tea bags often contain plastic releasing billions of microplastic particles into beverages when steeped this poses potential human health risk and contributes to environmental pollution since these bags are not fully compostable .thus a truly microplastic free safe and fully compostable tea bag solution is urgently needed

#  Social Innovation Program – Microplastics in Tea Bags  

##  Problem Statement  
Most commercial tea bags are made from plastic-based materials like polypropylene and nylon.  
When steeped in hot water, they release billions of **microplastic particles** into each cup.  
This not only poses **health risks** but also adds to **environmental pollution**, as these plastics are non-biodegradable.  

##  Contribution  
This project explores **eco-friendly alternatives** to plastic tea bags by:  
- Researching **biodegradable and compostable materials**.  
- Prototyping **safe, plastic-free tea bags**.  
- Conducting **awareness campaigns** on the risks of microplastics.  
- Engaging with **local tea producers** for sustainable adoption.  
- Advocating for **policy-level change** in packaging standards.  

## Goal  
To create a **sustainable, health-safe, and eco-friendly alternative** to conventional tea bags.

## The proposed solution is to design and promote biodegradable, plastic-free tea bags as an alternative to conventional plastic-based ones.

## Key Features of the Solution

1. Eco-Friendly Materials – Use of natural fibers such as banana fiber, cotton, hemp, corn starch, or jute, which are safe, compostable, and readily available.


2. Health-Safe – Eliminates microplastic release, ensuring that tea is free from harmful contaminants.


3. Sustainable Production – Encourage local farmers and communities to supply natural fibers, supporting livelihoods while reducing plastic dependency.


4. Cost-Effective Design – Develop prototypes that can be mass-produced at a low cost, making them affordable for both producers and consumers.


5. Awareness & Adoption – Educate consumers about the dangers of microplastics and promote the shift toward sustainable tea packaging.



## Long-Term Vision

Replace all plastic-based tea bags with 100% compostable alternatives.

Reduce microplastic pollution in food and beverages.

Influence tea brands and policymakers to adopt eco-friendly standards.

Create a replicable model that can be scaled to other packaging industries.
