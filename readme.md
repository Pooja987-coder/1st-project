# THE Problem Statement  
## Conventional tea bags often contain plastic releasing billions of microplastic particles into beverages when steeped this poses potential human health risk and contributes to environmental pollution since these bags are not fully compostable .thus a truly microplastic free safe and fully compostable tea bag solution is urgently needed

# ðŸŒ± Social Innovation Program â€“ Microplastics in Tea Bags  

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
Most commercial tea bags are made from plastic-based materials like polypropylene and nylon.  
When steeped in hot water, they release billions of **microplastic particles** into each cup.  
This not only poses **health risks** but also adds to **environmental pollution**, as these plastics are non-biodegradable.  

## ðŸ’¡ Contribution  
This project explores **eco-friendly alternatives** to plastic tea bags by:  
- Researching **biodegradable and compostable materials**.  
- Prototyping **safe, plastic-free tea bags**.  
- Conducting **awareness campaigns** on the risks of microplastics.  
- Engaging with **local tea producers** for sustainable adoption.  
- Advocating for **policy-level change** in packaging standards.  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  
- `docs/` â†’ Documentation & reports  
- `research/` â†’ Studies, surveys, data  
- `prototypes/` â†’ Design sketches & prototype details  
- `presentations/` â†’ PPTs, posters, awareness materials  
- `community/` â†’ Engagement activities & feedback  

## ðŸš€ Goal  
To create a **sustainable, health-safe, and eco-friendly alternative** to conventional tea bags.
